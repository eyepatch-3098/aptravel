**IMPORTANT**

This project was made with **Python 3.8.4**. While it might run on other versions of python, we can not guarantee it. While testing, we ran into issues with Python 3.9 when installing dependencies for the project, and there is no guarantee it will work in versions older than 3.8.4 either. To avoid running into any errors, we strongly recommend that you **completely uninstall your current version of Python and install v. 3.8.4. (13 July 2020 release)**

If you are on Windows, download Python 3.8.4 64-bit from this link. (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.4/python-3.8.4-amd64.exe) 
While installing, make sure to install it for all users, install all components, and select the **add to PATH** option.
